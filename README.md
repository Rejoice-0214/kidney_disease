Title: Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

Introduction:

This documentation report outlines the methodology and findings of a machine learning project aimed at predicting chronic kidney disease in patients. The project utilizes data sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "Kidney Disease" dataset. Python version 3.11 was employed for development, leveraging various libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and XGBoost Classifier for modeling. Additionally, the Streamlit framework was utilized for sharing the machine learning project.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

- Data Source: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, titled "Kidney Disease."
- Data Cleaning: Initial preprocessing involved renaming columns from abbreviations to their full names for clarity and understanding. Null values were checked, and missing values were filled with the mode for categorical data and the mean for numerical data to ensure data integrity.
- Data Encoding: Categorical data were encoded using LabelEncoder to convert them into numerical format, facilitating model training.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis was conducted using libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to gain insights into the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

Feature Engineering:

- Feature Importance: XGBoost Classifier was employed to determine the importance of features in predicting chronic kidney disease. This step helped in identifying the most influential features for model training.

Modeling:

- Model Selection: XGBoost Classifier was chosen as the primary model for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide robust predictions.
- Model Training: The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the XGBoost model was trained on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in predicting chronic kidney disease.

Deployment:

- Streamlit Integration: The machine learning project was deployed using the Streamlit framework, allowing for easy sharing and interaction with the predictive model.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this machine learning project successfully developed a predictive model for chronic kidney disease using the Kaggle dataset. By employing preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and XGBoost Classifier modeling, the project achieved reliable predictions. The integration of Streamlit facilitated the sharing and deployment of the project, making it accessible to a wider audience. Further improvements and refinements can be made to enhance the model's performance and expand its applicability in clinical settings.
